# Truth-tree exercise (`truth-tree@1`)

Students decide whether an argument is valid, or a set of sentences
consistent, with a truth tree (a semantic tableau), under the rules of
*forall x: UBC* (Ichikawa and Jenkins, after Magnus), identity included. The
authoring contract
is in
[`docs/carnap-markdown-v1.md`](../../../../docs/carnap-markdown-v1.md#truth-tree-directive).

## Three layers

1. **The tableau component, which knows no logic.** `src/tableau/` is its
   framework-free core (the document of nodes and rows, the edits, the
   shared-lines layout, the static markup, navigation and the key map), and
   `src/client/tableau/view.tsx` is its Preact view. A row's `cites` and
   `dev` are opaque to it; `kind` and `prefix` are there for the signed or
   world-labelled rows of a non-classical tableau. Boundary tests keep it
   free of this type and of the kit (`tests/tableau.test.ts`).
2. **The rules, as data.** `logic/system.ts` is the `TableauSystem` record:
   where a new name must be new, what closes a branch, whether a closure
   cites its rows, when a tree is done. `FORALLX_UBC` is the one record. A
   second classical textbook is a second record, selected by the stored
   `rules` field.
3. **The checker**, `logic/check.ts`, DOM-free: every row, every
   development, every branch end, and whether the tree is done. The browser
   runs it on each edit; the grader runs it again on the submitted tree.
   `logic/rules.ts` says what a row develops into. The binary connectives'
   rules are the kit's forcing sets (`exercise-kit/formula/forcing.ts`), the
   same computation the world's evaluation game makes its moves from.
   Identity (§12.7) is the checker's own: a step citing two rows, `a=b` and
   one to rewrite (the kit's `replaceName`), which develops neither; a
   branch closed by one row `a≠a`; and a completion clause asking each
   identity to be substituted one way into every literal on its branch,
   bar a rewriting that says something is itself (`b=b`), which the book's
   solutions leave out. A system record without `identity`
   refuses rows that use `=`.

## Layout

- `logic/` — `system.ts`, `rules.ts`, `check.ts`, `formulas.ts` (the
  caching row reader, and display through the language's own printer, which
  is what writes `a₁` and `a≠b`), `labels.ts` (margin notes and marks).
- `grading.ts` — guards, the declaration resolved back to formulas, and the
  judgement: the report, and what the tree shows once it is done.
- `annotations.ts` — what the tree draws beside its rows, for both the
  server's static tree and the editor.
- `authoring.ts`, `assessment.ts`, `read-only-view.ts`, `strings.ts`,
  `verdict-text.ts` — the usual halves of a type.

The editor is `src/client/components/carnap-truth-tree-v1.tsx`.

## Answer data

`truth-tree-answer@1` is `{ nodes }`, the tableau document: each node a run
of rows with its parent (`null` for the root) and an optional `end`,
`{ type: "closed", cites }` or `{ type: "open" }`. A row is
`{ id, text, cites, dev }`: its text as typed (fill mode stores what it
wrote), the row ids it develops, and the development it belongs to. The root
node's first rows must be the declared root. Ids are editing handles: the
editor remints them when it restores a tree, and citations follow.

The student is not asked what the tree shows: a done tree already says, and
a lesson that wants the question asked sets a multiple-choice exercise beside
it.

A bad tree is a valid wrong answer, scored zero with the first problem;
only JSON that is not a tree is refused. "Not a tree" includes nodes that do
not form one (the root first, each node after its parent, no node or row id
used twice), and a tree too big to be an attempt (1000 nodes or rows, a row
of 1000 characters, 128 KiB in all). A tree past the system's `rowCap` (200
rows) is answered "too many rows" without being read, since each row costs
a parse. A prior answer whose root is not the declaration's (a correction
changed it) is set aside when the element restores, as the root cannot be
edited.

## Not yet

- Reading an interpretation off a complete open branch, merging the names
  an identity on it equates (§12.7).
- A `rules=` attribute, which arrives with a second system record.
- The language accepts two things the book forbids: `((A & B))` and
  `∀x∃xFx`.
