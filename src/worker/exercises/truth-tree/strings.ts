/**
 * Every string the truth-tree widget can show, in the viewer's language: its
 * chrome, what is wrong with a row or a branch, the verdicts, and what each
 * edit announces.
 *
 * One list for both sides of the boundary. The element reads these out of its
 * hydration payload, and the server-rendered review reads the same map, so a
 * student who pressed Check before submitting reads back the identical
 * verdict. Keys are the English source text; the literals sit at the
 * `i18n.t(...)` call sites because Lingui's extractor reads only literals
 * passed to a receiver named `i18n`, and a slot the browser fills needs
 * `placeholders(...)` to survive the call.
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from the {@link Translator} type and the parser's own
 * sentences, because `read-only-view.ts` reaches this module and is compiled
 * into the browser preview bundle.
