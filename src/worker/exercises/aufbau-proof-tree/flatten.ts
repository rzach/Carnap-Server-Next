/**
 * Flatten a proof *tree* into the linear `.auf` proof text the Aufbau compiler
 * consumes. This is the crux of the tree exercise type: it is pure and DOM-free
 * so both the client editor (which compiles the result) and the server tests can
 * share it.
 *
 * A postorder traversal assigns each derived node a fresh label `l1..lN` —
 * children before their parent — so every citation is to an *earlier* line, as
 * the `.auf` grammar requires (no forward references). Each node emits
 *   `lN: $ <formula> $ by <rule> [<refs>]`
 * where `<refs>` is the comma-joined citation list of its premises: a child
 * derivation contributes its label, and a `hyp` leaf contributes `#<hyp>`
 * (a reference to the goal theorem's n-th hypothesis) without emitting a line.
 * Premise order is preserved left-to-right because rules are order-sensitive
 * (e.g. `and_intro [l3, l2]`).
 *
 * A node's text is not necessarily emitted as typed. `readFormula` reads it in
 * the theory's own language and gives back the engine spelling, so a student
 * may state a node `Ax(F(x)->G(x)) |- G(a)` where the compiler needs it fully
 * parenthesized and spaced. Unlike the Fitch and Prawitz types, whose lines
 * are bare formulas the translator wraps in a sequent, a tree node carries the
 * *whole* judgement — so its text is read at the sort the turnstile yields.
 * A theory that names neither a turnstile role nor a sentence sort passes every
 * node through untouched. A node's rule goes through `readRule` the same way:
 * an alias the theory declares becomes the engine's name, anything else
 * stands.
