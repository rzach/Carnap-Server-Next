/**
 * Interface text for the tree-proof widget: the shared proof-engine set, the
 * shared help-dialog frame, plus the editor's own toolbar, per-node problem
 * marker, and the usage instructions behind its `(?)`.
 *
 * The toolbar's tooltips name their shortcuts (`Undo (Ctrl-Z)`) as one message
 * rather than a label plus an appended key, because a translator may well want
 * the key elsewhere in the phrase — and because the shortcut itself is not
 * translated, only its framing.
 *
 * The help text is one message per paragraph and one per key row, not a single
 * block: the client's `t()` substitutes but does not format, so a table has to
 * be assembled from parts anyway — and a translator who receives each row beside
 * the key it explains cannot leave the two disagreeing, which the one long
 * sentence this replaced made easy.
