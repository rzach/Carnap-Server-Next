/**
 * Interface text for the Fitch proof widget: the shared proof-engine set, the
 * problem keys it shares with the linear editor, plus prose for every
 * structural problem the indentation-to-context translator can report.
 *
 * The translator itself carries only a {@link FitchDiagnosticCode} and its
 * parameters — no prose — so the same diagnostic can be worded in the student's
 * language here and asserted on by code in the tests.
 *
 * A placeholder must not be wrapped in ASCII apostrophes: these are ICU messages,
 * and `'{token}'` is ICU's *escape* for a literal `{token}` — so the quotes are
 * eaten and the brace stops being a placeholder at all. The student's own text is
 * quoted typographically instead, which ICU leaves alone.
