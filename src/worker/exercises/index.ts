/**
 * Every exercise type, once, in the order they are registered.
 *
 * This list is the whole registration: `application/content/registry.ts`
 * builds its lookups from it, and nothing else enumerates the types. Adding a
 * type is a folder beside these exporting one {@link ExerciseType} from its
 * `index.ts`, and one line here. Directive names carry no site prefix — a
 * `carnap-` on the front of each would only repeat the name of the site the
 * author is already writing for. The `aufbau-` on the proof types is
 * different: it names the engine that checks them, which is a real
 * distinction.
