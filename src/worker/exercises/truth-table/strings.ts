/**
 * Every string the truth-table widget can show, in the viewer's language.
 *
 * One list for both sides of the boundary: the interactive element reads these
 * out of its hydration payload (see `ExerciseHydration.strings`), and the
 * server-rendered review view reads the same map directly. That is deliberate —
 * the answering and review paths describe the same verdicts, and when each spelt
 * them out separately they drifted ("doesn't" here, "does not" there). Sharing
 * the map makes a single catalog entry serve both, so a translator sees one
 * sentence and cannot make them disagree.
 *
 * Keys are the English source text, which is what the client falls back to. The
 * literals must sit at the `i18n.t(...)` call sites: Lingui's extractor reads
 * string literals passed to a receiver *named* `i18n`, so hoisting one into a
 * constant would drop it from the catalog silently.
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from the {@link Translator} type, because
 * `read-only-view.ts` reaches this module and is compiled into the browser
 * preview bundle.
