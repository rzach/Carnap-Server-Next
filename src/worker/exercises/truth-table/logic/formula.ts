/**
 * Formula syntax for the truth-table exercise type.
 *
 * The language is not written here. It is whatever the exercise's `system=`
 * names — `logic/theories/carnap-prop.mm0`, registered by `logic/specs`, when
 * the author names nothing — an ordinary MM0 signature with `@syntax`
 * annotations, read by `@aufbau/syntax`; this module only converts what that
 * parser returns into the {@link Formula} tree a table is built from, and
 * writes one back out. The spec is the same kind of artifact a proof
 * exercise's `system=` names, and the same kind the model and translation
 * types read; before it there were two hand parsers here and next door, with
 * no way to make a course's truth tables and its models agree about what `A`
 * means.
 *
 * This module is DOM-free and imported by BOTH the worker (to compile a table
 * and grade authoritatively) and the client element (for instant local
 * checking), so it must not reach for any platform globals. The spec arrives
 * as a text import: no fetch, and the same reading on both sides.
 *
 * The default, `carnap-prop`, declares Carnap's `prop` notation:
 *   - `~`    negation      (unary prefix)
 *   - `/\`   conjunction
 *   - `\/`   disjunction
 *   - `->`   conditional   (right-associative)
 *   - `<->`  biconditional
 *
 * Those are the five that file declares, not the five this module can read:
 * it reads **all sixteen** binary truth functions plus `⊤` and `⊥`, one
 * `@syntax role` each (`logic/specs/connectives.ts`). A course whose textbook
 * uses the Sheffer stroke or exclusive disjunction declares the constructor in
 * an `aufbau-mm0` block extending `carnap-prop`, annotates it, names the
 * block with `system=`, and the table gives it a column with nothing changed
 * here.
 *
 * Sentence letters are a single Roman letter of either case. The hand parser
 * this replaced also read a bare-digit subscript (`P0`, `R12`); an MM0
 * signature is a finite vocabulary and cannot spell an unbounded one, and
 * Graham's call on 2026-08-24 was to accept the loss rather than hold the
 * unification for a library feature to restore it.
 *
 * In `carnap-prop`, precedence loosest to tightest is `<->` < `->` < `\/` <
 * `/\` < `~`; `/\`, `\/`, and `<->` are left-associative, `->` right. Another
 * system's ladder is its own.
