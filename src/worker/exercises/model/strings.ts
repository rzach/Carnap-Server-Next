/**
 * Every string the model widget can show, in the viewer's language.
 *
 * One list for both sides of the boundary: the interactive element reads these
 * out of its hydration payload (see `ExerciseHydration.strings`), and the
 * server-rendered review view reads the same map directly, so a student who
 * pressed Check before submitting reads back the identical verdict.
 *
 * Keys are the English source text, which is what the client falls back to. The
 * literals must sit at the `i18n.t(...)` call sites: Lingui's extractor reads
 * string literals passed to a receiver *named* `i18n`, so hoisting one into a
 * constant would drop it from the catalog silently. A `{slot}` a browser will
 * fill needs `placeholders(...)` to survive this call.
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from the {@link Translator} type, because
 * `read-only-view.ts` reaches this module and is compiled into the browser
 * preview bundle.
