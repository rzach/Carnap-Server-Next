/**
 * What a set of formulas asks a model to interpret.
 *
 * The exercise's fields are not authored — they are read off the formulas, so
 * that `AxR(x,f(x))` asks for a domain, an extension for `R(_,_)` and a value
 * table for `f(_)`, and nothing else. This is the original's
 * `blankTerms`/`blankFuncTerms` plus the sort inside `appendInputs`, with the
 * DOM taken out (`CounterModel.hs:260-302`).
 *
 * A symbol's identity includes its **arity**, matching Carnap, which keys
 * relations by `(index, arity)`: `F(a)` and `F(a,b)` are two different
 * predicates and get two separate fields.
 *
 * A variable that occurs **free** asks for a value too — the assignment the
 * formula is evaluated at — and gets a field of its own, filled in or given
 * exactly as a constant is. Only a language without `closed-sentences` lets
 * one through the parser, so for every closed exercise nothing changes.
