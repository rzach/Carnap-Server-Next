 * deployed Worker would leave every self-hoster's mail quota open. The table
 * costs one indexed read and one write per login attempt, on a path that is
 * about to send an email — the cheapest thing that happens there.
 *
 * A hit is charged when a link is *issued*, not when one is asked for. So a
 * throttled requester who waits does get back in as their earlier hits age out,
 * and an attacker cannot hold a shared campus address locked by hammering it.
 * What the count tracks is exactly the quantity being protected: mail sent.
 *
 * Read-then-write, with no lock, so two requests arriving together can both see
 * the last free slot and take it. That is the right trade here: the failure is
 * bounded by concurrency (a handful of extra emails, once), while a lock on the
 * login path would be a new way for signing in to fall over. A throttle only
 * has to make the abuse uneconomic, not count perfectly.
