/**
 * Every sentence the Carnap Markdown compiler can say to an author, in the
 * viewer's language.
 *
 * One module for all of them rather than one per exercise type, because unlike
 * widget text (which the server resolves per exercise and pushes into that
 * exercise's hydration payload) diagnostics all funnel into a single display —
 * the list under the revision editor — and a single union type. The compiler is
 * a leaf that the per-type `authoring.ts` files depend on, so its message ids
 * cannot be assembled by dispatch from the types that emit them.
 *
 * The mechanism is the same one the widgets use: keys are the English source
 * text, so a lookup that misses degrades to readable English, and
 * {@link DiagnosticMessageId} is derived from this map — `tsc` rejects a
 * `diagnostic(...)` whose sentence is not listed here, in either direction.
 *
 * Two conventions the compiler's messages need in particular:
 *
 * - The values are *unfilled* templates. A diagnostic knows which attribute or
 *   formula it is about only at compile time, so `placeholders(...)` keeps the
 *   `{slots}` intact through `i18n.t` for `resolveMessage` to fill later.
 * - A placeholder is quoted typographically (`“{name}”`), never with ASCII
 *   apostrophes: `'{name}'` is ICU's *escape* for a literal `{name}`, which
 *   eats the quotes and stops the brace being a placeholder at all. An
 *   apostrophe anywhere else (`':|-:'`, `'auto'`, `'.'`) is left alone by ICU
 *   and stays as the author typed it in the source it describes.
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from the {@link Translator} type: `diagnostics.ts`
 * imports the id type from here, and it is compiled into the browser preview
 * bundle.
