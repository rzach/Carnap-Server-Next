 * Answer a request that failed. A browser navigation gets the HTML error page;

 * the API's contract, and a scripted client left unable to parse a failure is
 * worse off than a reader shown prose meant for a program.
 *
 * The two carry different words on purpose. `message` is the English the
 * envelope has always held, for logs and clients; `readerMessage` is the same
 * fact worded for a person, in their language. It is a thunk so that reaching
 * for the translator — and rendering with it — happens only on the path that
 * shows prose, inside the guard below: this handler answers requests that were
 * rejected on their way in, and it may not assume the middleware that would have
 * put a translator on the context ever ran.
