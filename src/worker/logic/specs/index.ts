/**
 * Carnap's language specs: the id an author names with `system=`, and how each
 * becomes a {@link SurfaceLanguage} that parses what a student types and prints
 * it back.
 *
 * The *text* is not here. Every spec is an MM0 artifact in `../theories`, which
 * is the directory the route serves — so a language has a URL as well as an id,
 * and this module is only the reading end. `roles.ts` and `diagnostics.ts`
 * beside it are the rest of that end: what a constructor means, and how the
 * library's parse failures are said in Carnap's words.
 *
 * **One directory for the artifacts, not two.** A language and a proof system
 * are the same kind of file — forallx: Calgary is literally both, and
 * `carnap-prop` is a signature that has not been given rules — so sorting them
 * by whether they happen to have axioms would put two halves of one idea in two
 * places and give them somewhere to drift apart. It also means the reader here
 * has exactly one place to look.
 *
 * **Why one shared registry rather than one per exercise type.** A language is
 * cross-type: a model exercise and a translation set from the same course have
 * to agree on what `A` means, and before this each type carried its own
 * notation table and they did not. Splitting the specs by the type that happens
 * to read them first would preserve exactly that.
 *
 * A language an author declares in an `:::aufbau-mm0` block is read by the
 * same reader (`languageFromSource`) but is not registered here: it arrives as
 * text in the document, and `exercise-kit/systems` resolves it by name, block
 * before shipped id, into the document's own systems table.
