/**
 * What a spec's constructors *mean*, and how they are spelled.
 *
 * `@aufbau/syntax` deliberately has no connective set: it parses a signature
 * into a term tree and leaves what a node denotes to whoever teaches with it.
 * `@syntax role` is the channel it provides for saying so, and this module is
 * the reading end — the one place a Carnap exercise type turns
 * `term and (p q: wff): wff` into "this is conjunction".
 *
 * Two things come out of it, and the second is the less obvious one.
 *
 * **The role index** lets a semantic exercise convert a parse into its own
 * tree. The model type evaluates a `Formula`; the truth-table type builds
 * columns from one; neither can work on a bare constructor name, and neither
 * should have to know that this textbook happens to call conjunction `and`.
 *
 * **The canonical spelling** is how a formula is written back out. A spec
 * lists every accepted spelling of a connective as a separate notation and
 * the *last* is canonical — Aufbau's own rule, and the reason a spec puts its
 * ASCII forms first and its display glyph last. So forallx writes `∧` and
 * carnap-prop, which declares nothing but ASCII, writes `/\`; both are simply
 * that spec's last word on the matter. Before this existed the display
 * symbols were a hardcoded table in the parser and the source symbols a
 * second one in the dialect record, and the two could disagree with the
 * language they claimed to spell.
