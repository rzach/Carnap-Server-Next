/**
 * Carnap's built-in proof theories: one `.mm0` file per system a course can set
 * proofs in, and the one place their text lives.
 *
 * A theory is an ordinary MM0 theory — sorts, terms, notations, and the axioms
 * that are the system's rules — which the Aufbau compiler and verifier read
 * directly. An `:::aufbau-mm0` block names one by its path instead of carrying
 * three hundred lines of MM0 in the lesson source.
 *
 * **A theory may also be a language.** Both forallx files —
 * `forallx-calgary-2019.mm0` and `forallx-magnus.mm0` — carry
 * `@syntax` annotations and are registered by `../specs` under the language id
 * of the same stem, so `system=` on a model or translation exercise and `src=`
 * on a proof exercise's theory block name the same bytes and cannot disagree
 * about what `A` means. Two things follow for anyone reading these files. The
 * annotations are *not* the engine's — the systems join
 * (`exercise-kit/systems/join.ts`) strips them where an exercise's frozen
 * text is read back, and anything else handing this text to the compiler
 * must too. And a
 * file that plays both roles cannot spell its context separator `,`, because
 * the comma is the student's argument separator; it says so itself with
 * `@syntax role context-join`, which is what the proof types read.
 *
 * **Everything is named by a URL.** These paths are real: the route at
 * {@link THEORY_ROUTE_PREFIX} serves this same text, so an author can open one
 * and read the rule names and the commentary that ships with them. The
 * compiler, though, never goes over the wire for a built-in — it answers from
 * the module graph below. Same address, same bytes, no network, which is what
 * lets a theory resolve identically in the worker, in the browser preview
 * (`src/client/editor-preview.ts` runs this compiler too), and in tests that
 * call `compileCarnapMarkdown` with no server anywhere.
 *
 * That is the seam the rest of the namespace grew into. **There are two
 * backings now.** A built-in answers from the module graph above; an
 * instructor-hosted theory is a URL under `/content/` (see
 * {@link hostedTheoryPath}) answered by a store read in the Worker and by a
 * same-origin fetch in the author's browser — which is how one address means
 * one thing in both places. A foreign origin is the branch after that, and is
 * still refused. What a path *means* did not change when the second backing
 * was added, and that is the property the namespace exists for.
 *
 * **Why `.mm0` files rather than string constants** is the argument in
 * `../specs/index.ts`, and the shape is the same: the import attribute costs no
 * loader configuration under workerd, `bun build`, or `bun test` alike (see
 * `src/text-modules.d.ts`). Unlike a spec, a theory is not parsed here — it is
 * text handed to the engine — so there is nothing for this module to validate.
 * What proves these good is that `scripts/forallx-verify.ts`,
 * `scripts/magnus-verify.ts` and `scripts/gentzen-verify.ts` compile real
 * proofs against them through the real compiler and verifier.
