/**
 * Strings for the server-generated enhancement scripts (served as hashed
 * assets, see `./script-assets`).
 *
 * Those scripts are JavaScript we emit as text, so they cannot call `i18n.t`
 * themselves — and interpolating translated prose into a script body would put
 * arbitrary text inside a string literal we are also escaping for HTML. Instead
 * each script gets a sibling `<script type="application/json">` payload and
 * reads it through {@link readStringsPrelude}, which is the pattern the exercise
 * runtime already uses for its state (`data-carnap-exercise-runtime-state`).
 *
 * Every lookup in a script is written `S.key || "English"`, so a page cached
 * from before a payload existed still says something sensible.
 *
 * One payload per document region, each rendered next to the script that reads
 * it: the layout owns the chrome strings, the assignment page owns its own. A
 * single shared payload would mean the layout had to know what the assignment
 * page's scripts need.
 */

/**
 * Resolve a builder's messages, keeping only the ones the browser could not
 * have worked out for itself.
 *
 * Every payload here is a lookup with an English fallback on the reading side,
 * so an entry whose translation *is* the text the reader would have fallen back
 * to is bytes on the wire that change nothing. In English that is all of them:
 * the diagnostics map alone measured 9.2 KB on every English editor page, 73
 * sentences each mapped to itself.
 *
 * The filter runs while the builder resolves rather than over the finished map,
 * because the fallback is `options.message ?? id` — a disambiguated id
 * ("Correct (truth-table cell)" displaying "Correct") is just as redundant when
 * it resolves to its own display text, and only the call knows that. For the
 * same reason the keys here are catalog *ids*, not whatever the builder chose to
 * key its own map by: an id is what {@link payloadTranslator} will be asked for.
