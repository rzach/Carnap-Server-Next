/**
 * Styles come in two layers. CONTENT_STYLES carries everything that styles
 * authored content and exercise forms; it is shared between the app shell and
 * the standalone content documents served into iframes, so the two render
 * identically. CHROME_STYLES is app-shell only (navigation, sheets, tables of
 * records, dialogs).
 *
 * The split is what the two layers are *for*, and it is also what makes them
 * worth caching separately: a lesson page is two documents, and the shared
 * layer is then one download that serves both. See `./style-assets`, which
 * turns each into a hashed URL — nothing here is embedded in a page.
 *
 * The rules themselves are in `./content.css`, the kit's `exercise.css`,
 * `./utilities.css` and `./chrome.css`, read as text (see `src/text-modules.d.ts`). What is left
 * here is the assembly, which is all this module was ever doing that CSS
 * cannot do for itself: two generated `@font-face` blocks whose URLs carry
 * package versions, and two shared blocks other modules also serve into shadow
 * roots.
