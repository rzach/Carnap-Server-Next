/**
 * What kind of source a content item holds — a lesson, or an MM0 artifact.
 *
 * `markdown` is a lesson in Carnap markdown: it compiles to a document, it is
 * what an assignment points at, and it is what every item was until MM0 items
 * arrived. `mm0` is a theory or a language — the same kind of file
 * `/theories/` serves, hosted by an instructor instead of shipped by us. It
 * compiles to nothing readable: its "document" is a validation, and what a
 * lesson does with it is name it in an `aufbau-mm0` block's `src=`.
 *
 * The two share ownership, revisions with the author's note, and the library
 * listing, because those are properties of *authored text* and not of what the
 * text says. What they do not share is anywhere a compiled document is
 * expected — which is why an assignment cannot be set on an `mm0` revision.

 * web, and the only scope an anonymous request can satisfy.
 *
 * Three values rather than a flag because `authors` is what a sharing layer
 * will want and because it is the setting that says "not the open web" out
 * loud. With no discovery anywhere, it differs from `public` today by exactly
