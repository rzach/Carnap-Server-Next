/**
 * First-order syntax for the exercise types that read formulas — the model and
 * the translation.
 *
 * The reading is of the parsed *tree*, never of the notation: a symbol is its
 * constructor's name applied to the arguments its binders hold, so `plus (x y:
 * tm): tm` written `x + y`, a fixed-arity `Red(a)`, and a textbook's variadic
 * `R(a,b)` or `Rab` all become the same shape. What the spec has to say is
 * which sorts hold *individuals* (`@syntax role individual`; a symbol is
 * interpreted only over those, see {@link firstOrderSignature}) and which,
 * if any, a variadic letter's argument list lives in (`@syntax role
 * argument-list`, see {@link readArguments}).
 *
 * The language is not written here. It is a spec `logic/specs` registers — for
 * forallx that is `logic/theories/forallx-calgary-2019.mm0`, the same file the
 * proof exercises name as their theory — an ordinary MM0 signature with
 * `@syntax` annotations, read by `@aufbau/syntax`; this module only converts
 * what that parser returns into the {@link Formula} tree the two types
 * evaluate, and writes one back out. The notation table, the precedence
 * ladder, the bracket conventions and the refusals all live in the spec, which
 * is quite literally the same artifact a proof exercise's `system=` names.
 *
 * DOM-free and imported by BOTH the worker (to compile an exercise and grade
 * authoritatively) and the client elements (for the local Check), so it must
 * not reach for any platform globals. The spec arrives as a text import, so
 * this costs the browser bundle the spec's own source and nothing else — no
 * fetch, and the same reading on both sides.
 *
 * Two grammar choices still worth stating, because they surprise people and
 * are now the spec's doing rather than this file's:
 *
 *   - **A quantifier's scope is a single primary**, not the rest of the
 *     formula. `AxF(x) -> G(a)` is `(AxF(x)) -> G(a)`; to quantify over the
 *     conditional you write `Ax(F(x) -> G(a))`. Negation scopes the same way.
 *   - `/\` and `\/` share a precedence rung, so `P /\ Q \/ R` is `(P /\ Q) \/ R`
 *     by left association — not because conjunction binds tighter, which it
 *     does not.
 *   - **The conditionals join nothing unbracketed.** forallx marks `->` and
 *     `<->` non-associative on that same one rung, so `P -> Q -> R`,
 *     `P -> Q <-> R` and `P /\ Q -> R` are all errors rather than readings.
 *     That is the spec's `@syntax forbid chain mix nest`, not a precedence:
 *     the rungs are what the engine parses this file's own math strings by.
