 * The language an exercise is set in, or `null` where its stored data no longer

 *
 * `null` means there is no language here at all — no `source`, no `dialect`, or
 * text that does not read as a spec. It does not mean "a language these types
 * refuse": there is no such thing now. A capability predicate used to sit here
 * demanding quantifiers, which made `carnap-prop` unusable for propositional
 * translation, and a language whose binder carried no `@syntax role` satisfied
 * it anyway. Whether a *formula* uses something these types cannot evaluate is
 * asked of that formula, by `./formula.ts`, which can also name the construct.
 *
 * Two shapes arrive here, and the newer one is the reason this takes a payload
 * rather than a name. `source` is the language's own text, joined in from the
 * document's systems table (see `../systems/join.ts`) — which is what lets an
 * author set a model exercise in a language they declared themselves. `dialect`
 * is the older shape, a bare id resolved from the specs that ship, and it is
 * read for every artifact compiled before the table existed.
