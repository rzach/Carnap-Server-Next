/**
 * An argument as an author writes it on one line: `premises :|-: conclusions`,
 * each side a comma-separated list of formulas.
 *
 * Every type that asks about an argument reads this one spelling (the truth
 * table's validity variant, the model's and the world's counterexamples, a
 * truth tree's validity question), so an author meets one notation for "this
 * argument" wherever they write one. The turnstile is ASCII because `∴` and
 * `⊢` are hard to type. If a second spelling is ever accepted, it belongs
 * here, for every type at once.
 *
 * What a missing side or a stray turnstile means is each type's to say: a
 * truth table needs premises, a tree does not.
