/**
 * The text every proof widget — linear `.auf`, Fitch, tree and Prawitz — has
 * to be able to say, because they all drive the same WASM compiler through
 * the same pipeline (the client's `components/proof-element.ts`): the engine
 * failing, the proof it could not read, a playground with no readable goal,
 * and the `allow-sorry` protocol. The Prawitz widget cannot admit a line
 * (its `enhance` says why), so the last of those never fires there — but the
 * gate that would say it is the one it shares.
 *
 * The verdict itself is not here: it is the shared correctness mark in the
 * action bar, which the server renders with the names for all four of its
 * states on it, so no widget carries text for it. Nor is text that only some
 * of the four read — the `Prove` label, the two CodeMirror editors' fallback
 * for a diagnostic with no message, Fitch's read-only review editor — which
 * each of those widgets' own `strings.ts` carries, so a widget ships only the
 * ids it looks up. Ids are the English text, so a sentence two of them share
 * is still one catalog entry.
 *
 * Note what is *not* here: the compiler's own diagnostics. Those are translated
 * upstream, not by us — `@aufbau/compiler` carries its own catalogs and picks
 * one from the locale `client/proof-compiler.ts` hands it, so a language Aufbau
 * has not translated reaches the student's editor gutter in English however
 * complete our own catalog is. These are our wrappers around it.
