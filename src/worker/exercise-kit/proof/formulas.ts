/**
 * Reading a proof's formulas as *surface* text.
 *
 * A proof widget emits `.auf`, and the Aufbau compiler's math parser reads
 * engine text: every token whitespace-separated, every compound operand
 * parenthesized, one canonical spelling per constructor. Left to itself that
 * is what the student has to type — `∀ x (F(x) → G(x))` with the space after
 * the quantifier, no `Ax`, no `~`, no `/\` — while a model or translation
 * exercise set from the very same artifact takes the tight textbook form. The
 * two disagreed about the *layer* long after #241 stopped them disagreeing
 * about the language.
 *
 * This module closes that: parse what the student wrote against the theory's
 * own spec, print the result back in engine mode, and hand *that* to the
 * translator. Two things fall out beyond the notation. A formula that will not
 * read is caught here, with a caret at the character that broke it, instead of
 * arriving as a compiler unification failure about a line the student cannot
 * connect to what they typed. And the spec's lints — forallx's bracket
 * discipline, its refusal of open sentences — start applying to proofs, having
 * previously applied only to the exercise types that parse.
 *
 * **One condition: the theory must name a sort to read this shape at.** For a
 * Fitch or Prawitz line that is the sort carrying `@syntax role sentence`; for
 * a tree node it is the sort the turnstile yields, falling back to the sentence
 * sort. A file naming neither — `gentzen-lk`, which declares no `@syntax` at
 * all — reads as it always did.
 *
 * Note what that condition is *not* (#274). `gentzen-lk` parses as a spec, and
 * the `SurfaceLanguage` built from it reads that file's own formulas quite
 * happily, off the ordinary MM0 notations it declares. It is a language; it
 * simply never says which sort a student's line is in, and nothing here will
 * guess one. The gate is on the sort, asked where the sort is needed.
 *
 * There used to be a second condition, and getting rid of it is what #253 was
 * (see {@link goalBinderScope}). A goal that binds metavariables —
 * `theorem mp (a b: wff): $ (a → b) ; a ⊢ b $`, which is how a textbook states
 * a rule, and how 12 of the 19 forallx rule cases are written — shadows the
 * theory's own lexicon for the length of that theorem. A parse that does not
 * know the binders reads them as the lexicon's letters instead, and does it
 * *quietly*: `P` becomes the predicate letter `P (snil)`, and no proof of that
 * goal can close. #250 dealt with this by refusing to read such a goal at all;
 * the scope deals with it by telling the parser what the engine already knows,
 * which reads those 12 rather than declining them.
 *
 * DOM-free and catalog-free: the client editor compiles the `.auf` it submits,
 * so the browser runs this too, and its complaints travel as unfilled English
 * templates plus values (see `logic/specs/diagnostics.ts`) for the widget's
 * string map to word.

 * to exactly what `x` already meant, and every first-order goal must bind the
 * variables it quantifies over, so warning there would report something no
 * author can avoid. Shadowing means a *different* meaning was pushed aside.
 *
 * At most one per binder, and a `notation` collision outranks a lexicon one:
 * both are worth knowing, but a name that is also a notation or an elab
 * literal takes that spelling away for the length of the exercise, which is
 * the surprising half and the half that makes a line stop parsing.

 *
 * A declaration is MM0, and MM0's own math strings are engine text: `∃x` is
 * one token to the engine, and a Calgary sentence letter `P` is a term
 * wanting its elided argument. (The operator spellings are not the problem:
 * `\/`, `->` and the rest are ordinary MM0 notations, and the engine reads
 * them once no delimiter splits them — which is why the forallx theories keep
 * `/` out of their engine delimiters.) So
 * an author writing the goal the way they write the lines — which is the
 * only way a student ever sees it — got a declaration the engine refused,
 * and the refusal surfaced as the widget's "extra proof block with no
 * matching theorem". Reading the goal the way the lines are read closes both
 * halves of that: the engine is handed what it can parse, and what it cannot
 * is an authoring diagnostic with the parser's own complaint.
 *
 * What is rewritten is the math strings alone — hypothesis binders,
 * `>`-chain hypotheses, the conclusion — spliced back into the declaration's
 * own text, so the name, the binders and the shape of the statement stay the
 * author's. Each reads at the sort a tree node reads at (the turnstile's, or
 * the sentence's where there is none); a goal stated as a bare sentence over
 * a theory that also has a turnstile falls back to the sentence sort, since
 * `⊢ P → P` and `P → P` are both things such a theory can be asked to prove.
 *
 * Read without the lints. Bracket discipline, chain refusal and closed
 * sentences are the conventions a student's *line* is held to, and a goal is
 * not a student's line: `(∀ x F(x)) ∧ G(a)` is not the book's spelling, but it
 * is grammatical, it means what the engine will take it to mean, and it is
 * the author's to show. What is refused is what is not the language at all —
 * an explicit `snil`, or `F a` juxtaposed where the language spells `F(a)` —
 * since a goal the student could not type in any spelling is not a goal to
 * hand them. Fully parenthesized text, engine output included, reads. `aufbau-proof` never calls this, its
 * students typing engine text by definition.
