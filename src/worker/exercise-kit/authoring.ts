 * takes a {@link CompiledExercise} back. The Markdown pipeline itself — the
 * parser, the sanitizer, the prompt renderers — stays with the application in
 * `markdown.ts`; a type imports both, and this module reads only the

 * for the two server-rendered answer forms, as an HTML `id`/`for` pair — none
 * of which needs a character class narrower than the one HTML already gives.
 * A tighter rule than that would only be refusing `ex1.2` to no purpose, which
 * is what this used to do.
 *
 * Excluded past HTML's rule, all for the same reason — an id that cannot be
 * seen cannot be typed back or told apart: whitespace of every kind rather than
 * just ASCII's, so a non-breaking space is not an invisible difference between
 * two ids; control characters; and format characters, which include the bidi
 * overrides that would let one id render as another.
 *
 * A dotted id has to be written `id="ex1.2"`. The `#` shorthand cannot spell
 * one, because `.` opens a class there — see `docs/carnap-markdown-v1.md`.

 * exists (`diagnostics.ts`, and `compileCarnapMarkdown` fails the compile only

 * and an attribute nothing reads is never that. The cost is real and
 * accepted: a stored revision carrying a stray attribute will refuse to re-save
