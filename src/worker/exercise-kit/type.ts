/**
 * What one exercise type is, to everything outside its folder.
 *
 * Each folder under `src/worker/exercises/` exports one {@link ExerciseType}
 * from its `index.ts`, and `src/worker/exercises/index.ts` lists them once, in
 * order. The registry (`application/content/registry.ts`) is a set of lookups
 * over that list — by directive name for the compiler, by kind for grading, by
 * asset id for rendering — and nothing else enumerates the types. Before this
 * there were three registries and four hand-written switches, and adding a type
 * meant editing all seven; a type that missed one rendered read-only with no
 * form, which looked like "the widget is not hydrating" and was diagnosed
 * twice before anyone thought to count the registration points.
 *
 * The identity fields say what the type is called in every vocabulary it has
 * a name in: the directive an author writes, the kind a manifest item records,
 * the answer kind an envelope carries, and the component the page renders.
 * `component.capabilities` is the one place capabilities are declared; the
 * compiler copies them onto each manifest item.
