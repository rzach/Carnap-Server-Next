/**
 * Where everything in a tableau goes: the line each row sits on, the columns
 * each node spans, and the connectors between them. A pure function of the
 * document, so the server's read-only view and the browser editor draw the
 * same tree from the same answer.
 *
 * **Lines are shared across branches**, as in the textbooks: a row's number
 * is the line it sits on, and a line has one justification in the margin. A
 * row takes the first line below the row above it on its branch whose margin
 * is still free, or already carries the same justification. So when a step is
 * repeated on two branches, the two copies sit on the same lines under one
 * margin note, and a different step on another branch waits for fresh lines.
 * The lines a branch skips are drawn as a dotted guide.
 *
 * The justification a line carries is its rows' citations. A row with none
 * yet stands for its own development, so it shares a line only with the other
 * rows of that step (the two sides of a split, say).
 *
 * **A step is justified once**, beside its first line, as in the book: a row
 * under another of the same development continues that step, and a line of
 * such rows only has its margin left blank. That blank is what tells a step's
 * second row from a new step that cites the same row.
 *
 * **Columns are leaves.** Each leaf is one column, and a node spans the
 * columns of the leaves below it, so a node's rows are centred over its
 * branches.
