/**
 * The author preview's "Copy as source": a button in the exercise's action bar
 * that copies what the author has built in the widget as directive source, so
 * an edited world or a proof tree can be pasted back into the lesson as the
 * exercise's starting point.
 *
 * Preview only. A student has no source to paste anything into, so the button
 * exists only in the revision editor's live preview — a `srcdoc` frame with no
 * submission form around the exercise. The saved-revision view has no form
 * either, but it is not being edited.
 *
 * In the bar rather than in the widget, for the reasons the `(?)` is (see
 * `mountHelpTrigger`): one row of controls for every type, which author CSS
 * can reach and a rerendering island cannot pull out from under focus. It goes
 * before Submit, after whatever the widget has already put there. "Copied." is
 * said on the bar's submission status line, which a preview never submits to
 * and so never uses.
