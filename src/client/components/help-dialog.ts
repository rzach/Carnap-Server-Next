 * takes plain, already-translated strings — a widget passes what its `t()`
 * returned and never has to reach a catalog from here. The panel is created once
 * and appended to the widget's shadow root, outside any render tree; the trigger
 * is a light-DOM button in the action bar (see {@link mountHelpTrigger}), which
 * also means a rerendering island cannot pull the focused control out from under
 * an open dialog.
 *
 * Instructions live behind the button rather than on the page because they stop
 * being useful after the first minute and the space they take never stops being
 * spent. Nothing of them is left visible — the `(?)` is the whole affordance.
