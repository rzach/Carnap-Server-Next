/**
 * The glyphs on the tree and Prawitz editors' toolbars, and in the legend the
 * help dialog draws of them.
 *
 * Nothing here is a picture of an action in the abstract; there is no shared
 * visual vocabulary for "add a premise". Each glyph is instead a miniature of
 * the notation the student is already reading: a short dash is a formula, the
 * long rule is an inference line, square brackets are an assumption leaf
 * (`[A]¹`, as Prawitz writes it), and a `+` or `×` sits where the new or
 * removed thing is. So *add premise* is a `+` beside a dash above a line, *apply
 * rule below* is a `+` under one, and *delete* is an `×` above a line with the
 * conclusion left standing below it — which is what delete does. Undo and redo
 * borrow the arrows everything else uses.
 *
 * Two constraints shaped the drawing. A `+` centred over a line reads as `±`
 * and one under it as `÷` at button size — the wrong association to invite in
 * a logic course — so the `+` sits beside an existing premise, as a new
 * premise would. And everything is a stroke in `currentColor`: the buttons are
 * inside a shadow root, where an author's theme cannot restyle text but the
 * icons follow the button's colour for free. That is why the toolbars carry no
 * visible words at all; the name is the button's `aria-label`, and the legend
 * in the help dialog is where a student learns what a glyph means.
 *
 * The paths are data rather than markup because two consumers want them in
 * different shapes: the help dialog builds DOM (see {@link createToolbarIcon})
 * and the editors render JSX (see `toolbar-icon.tsx`).
