/**
 * `<carnap-aufbau-proof-tree>` — the interactive *tree* proof editor.
 *
 * The student builds a proof tree instead of typing linear proof lines. The
 * server renders an inert goal seed into a Declarative Shadow Root (see
 * `renderAufbauProofTreeElement`); on connect this element adopts that shadow
 * root and mounts a small Preact island that renders the tree with editing
 * affordances: each node's conclusion and inference rule are editable, a node
 * can be selected, and a toolbar adds a premise, adds a hypothesis reference, or
 * deletes the selected subtree. A hypothesis leaf is a *citation* of one of the
 * goal's hypotheses, not a line: its text is the cited hypothesis, read from the
 * goal declaration and never typed, and its inference slot is the choice of
 * which one (a select when the goal offers more than one). The tree is drawn by
 * the vendored ProofML custom
 * elements (imported here for their side effect of registering `<proof-tree>`
 * etc.); Preact renders those custom-element tags declaratively.
 *
 * The editable document (`{ model, selectedId }`) is an *immutable* value driven
 * by a pure reducer, so a re-render is `render(view(doc), mount)` and structural
 * edits (add/delete, undo/redo) never poke the DOM by hand. Only the
 * contenteditable text fields are *uncontrolled* — Preact renders each once
 * (keyed by node id) and never rewrites its text while it is focused, so the
 * caret survives typing (the same reason the linear editor leans on CodeMirror).
 * Preact is used only on the interactive path; on review pages the module still
 * just registers the ProofML elements and no island mounts.
 *
 * On every model edit the tree is flattened (postorder) to the same `.auf` the
 * linear editor produces and compiled against the frozen theory with the
 * lazily-loaded `@aufbau/compiler`; the answer mirrored into the form is
 * `{ mmb, proofText, tree }`. As with the linear type the MMB is the certificate
 * and the worker is the arbiter — the compiler here is an untrusted convenience.
 * A compiler diagnostic (a UTF-8 byte span into the flattened text) is mapped
 * back through the flattener's line map onto the tree node that produced the
 * offending line. The debounce, the superseding compile, the certificate and
 * the submit gate are `./proof-element.ts`, shared with the other three.
