/**
 * `<carnap-aufbau-proof-prawitz>` — the interactive *Prawitz* proof editor.
 *
 * Prawitz trees are built **top-down**: the student starts free-standing
 * assumptions, then derives downward — select one or more trees and apply a
 * rule *below* them, turning the selected roots into the premises of a new
 * conclusion. The workspace is therefore a **forest** of independent subtrees
 * (unlike the goal-rooted tree editor, which only grows upward), and the
 * exercise is done when the forest has joined into a single tree whose root is
 * the goal. Backward growth is still available — a premise or assumption can
 * be added *above* a derived node — so a student may also meet in the middle.
 *
 * Discharge is marked exactly as the textbook writes it: an assumption leaf
 * carries a label field (`[A]¹`) and a rule node a discharge field (the `¹`
 * beside the inference line); typing the same label in both is the whole
 * gesture. Because rules are order-sensitive, **selection order is premise
 * order** when applying a rule below — multi-selected roots show their ordinal.
 *
 * The editable document (`{ trees, selected }`) is an *immutable* value driven
 * by a pure reducer, so a re-render is `render(view(doc), mount)` and
 * structural edits (apply/delete, undo/redo) never poke the DOM by hand. Only
 * the contenteditable text fields are *uncontrolled* — Preact renders each once
 * (keyed by node id) and never rewrites its text while it is focused, so the
 * caret survives typing. Preact is used only on the interactive path; on review
 * pages the module still just registers the ProofML elements and no island
 * mounts.
 *
 * Once the forest is a single tree, every edit translates it (`prawitzToAuf`:
 * discharge labels → boxes → dependency sequent contexts) and compiles the `.auf`
 * against the frozen theory with the lazily-loaded `@aufbau/compiler`; the
 * answer mirrored into the form is `{ mmb, proofText, tree }`. As with the
 * sibling types the MMB is the certificate and the worker is the arbiter — the
 * compiler here is an untrusted convenience. A compiler diagnostic (a UTF-8
 * byte span into the translated text) is mapped back through the translator's
 * line map onto the tree node that produced the offending line; the
 * translator's own structural diagnostics (a discharge mark with no matching
 * assumption, mixed formulas under one mark) surface the same way. The
 * debounce, the superseding compile, the certificate and the submit gate are
 * `./proof-element.ts`, shared with the other three.
