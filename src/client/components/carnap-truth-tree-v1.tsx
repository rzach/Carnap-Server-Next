/**
 * `<carnap-truth-tree>` — the truth-tree editor.
 *
 * The server renders the root into a Declarative Shadow Root, inert and drawn
 * with no JS (see the worker-side `renderTruthTreeElement`). On connect this
 * element replaces that body with a Preact island: the tableau view over the
 * tree and its toolbar. The tree is the whole answer; what it shows follows
 * from it, so the student is not asked to say.
 *
 * Every action is one key (or one toolbar button, whose keys the `(?)`
 * dialog lists) on the row at the cursor,
 * and works on that row's branch. In `develop="type"` the student writes each
 * step: Stack or Split, then the rows' sentences, then the row they develop in
 * the margin. In `develop="fill"` Develop writes the rule's rows under every
 * open branch below the row, asking only for an instance's name (and, on an
 * identity, the row to rewrite with it). Closing a branch cites its two rows,
 * or its one row `a≠a`; ↑ marks one open and complete.
 *
 * The mouse follows the proof tree's conventions: a click on a row types in
 * it, a click in its margin types its citation, and a click elsewhere ends
 * the typing, so the arrow keys move between rows again. The ring shows
 * when they do.
 *
 * The tree is checked on every edit by the same `checkTree` the grader runs,
 * so full feedback can flag a wrong row as it is written. Marks and margin
 * notes are computed, never typed. As with the model, there is no answer key:
 * the Check is `judgeTree` over public data.
