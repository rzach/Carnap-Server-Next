/**
 * `<carnap-aufbau-proof>` — the interactive proof editor.
 *
 * The server renders inert chrome into a Declarative Shadow Root (see the
 * worker-side `renderAufbauProofElement`): the prompt and the starting proof
 * source, styled with no JS. On connect this element replaces the static source
 * with a small CodeMirror editor for the proof body, shows the theorem to prove,
 * and gives live feedback: as the student types (debounced) it assembles the
 * full `.auf`, compiles it against the frozen theory with the lazily-loaded
 * `@aufbau/compiler` (WebAssembly), and reports whether it verifies.
 *
 * The answer mirrored into the form's hidden `answerData` is `{ proofText, mmb }`
 * — the MMB is the compiled certificate, and the worker re-verifies it against
 * the same frozen mm0 (the compiler here is an untrusted convenience; the
 * server-side verifier is the arbiter).
 *
 * Feedback is deliberately quiet: the shared correctness mark in the action bar
 * (a spinner while checking, a green check once it verifies), and any problems
 * shown inline in the editor as CodeMirror lint squiggles with hover detail — the
 * compiler reports UTF-8 byte spans into the proof, which we map back onto the
 * editable body. Author toggles for proof search (`auto?`) and completion are
 * carried in the options but not yet wired to editor assistance.
 *
 * The debounce, the superseding compile, the certificate and the submit gate
 * are `./proof-element.ts`, shared with the other three proof widgets; the
 * chrome and lint helpers are `./proof-editor.ts`, shared with Fitch.
