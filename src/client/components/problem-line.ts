/**
 * The line under a proof where F8 leaves the problem it went to.
 *
 * A squiggle's message is otherwise a hover tooltip: it needs a pointer to
 * float, and where it floats it covers the lines around it. The line shows it
 * below the proof instead, and keeps it there while the reader goes off to
 * fix it — usually somewhere else, at a line the problem cites — until F8
 * goes to another or the problem is gone. Where the problem is gets a tint
 * (the `is-pinned` and `cm-problem-pinned` rules in `./problem-line.css`).
 * Hovering a squiggle still floats its tooltip, as it did.
 *
 * Not a live region. F8 already says the problem — the CodeMirror editors
 * announce it, and the tree and Prawitz editors move focus onto a line
 * described by it — and a line that spoke as well would say everything
 * twice. It is ordinary text, met in place by a reader walking the page.
 *
 * Framework-free, like the help dialog, so the CodeMirror editors and the two
 * Preact islands share it; it is mounted outside any render tree.
