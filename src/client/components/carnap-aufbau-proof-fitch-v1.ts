/**
 * `<carnap-aufbau-proof-fitch>` — the interactive Fitch-style proof editor.
 *
 * The server renders inert chrome into a Declarative Shadow Root (see the
 * worker-side `renderAufbauProofFitchElement`): the prompt and the starting
 * Fitch source, styled with no JS. On connect this element replaces the static
 * source with a CodeMirror editor that draws the subproof scope-lines, shows the
 * theorem to prove, and gives live feedback: as the student types (debounced) it
 * translates the Fitch text to linear `.auf` (`fitchToAuf`), compiles that
 * against the frozen theory with the lazily-loaded `@aufbau/compiler`, and
 * reports whether it verifies.
 *
 * The answer mirrored into the form's hidden `answerData` is `{ fitchText,
 * proofText, mmb }` — the MMB is the compiled certificate, and the worker
 * re-verifies it against the same frozen mm0 (the compiler here is an untrusted
 * convenience; the server-side verifier is the arbiter).
 *
 * Two diagnostic sources feed the same CodeMirror lint layer: `fitchToAuf`'s
 * structural problems (bad indentation, unknown references) map straight to the
 * offending source line, and the compiler's problems — reported as byte spans
 * into the generated `.auf` — are mapped back through the translator's
 * `lineSpans` to the Fitch line that produced them.
 *
 * The debounce, the superseding compile, the certificate and the submit gate
 * are `./proof-element.ts`, shared with the other three proof widgets; the
 * chrome and lint helpers are `./proof-editor.ts`, shared with the linear
 * editor.
