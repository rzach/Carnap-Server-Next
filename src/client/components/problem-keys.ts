 * — or hover them — can still reach what they say. The two CodeMirror editors
 * bind the same keys to CodeMirror's own diagnostic commands
 * (`./proof-editor.ts`), so all four proof widgets answer one key alike.
 *
 * Each line with a problem carries a hidden note, named by its treeitem's
 * `aria-describedby` (see {@link problemNoteId}): moving focus there says the
 * line and then its problem. The note is hidden rather than visually hidden,
 * because a description is read from a hidden element all the same, and a
 * reader walking the page in browse mode should not meet every message a
 * second time, out of place.
 *
 * The line F8 goes to is also pinned ({@link PinnedProblem}): its problem is
 * shown in the problem line under the proof and its formula tinted, and both
 * stay while the reader works elsewhere.
