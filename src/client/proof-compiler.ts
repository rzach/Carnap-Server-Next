 * instantiate two modules because each widget memoized its own.

 * What a compile established, read the way a proof exercise needs to read it.

 * that MMB carries a `Sorry` instruction the verifier refuses, so handing it to
 * the server would only turn a green mark here into a red one there. A student
 * proof never scores with an admitted line, whatever the exercise allows.
 *
 * What the student is *told* about one is the exercise's call. By default an
 * admitted line is a problem at that line, and the engine's warning is
 * promoted to say so; `admitted` stays false, because to that exercise the
 * line is an error like any other and gets an error's treatment. With
 * `allowSorry` the warning stays a warning, listed in `problems` with its
 * severity intact, and `admitted` says the proof is one of those: every line
 * checks except the ones the student has admitted. (The engine reports
 * admissions only on a compile with no errors, so `admitted` never
 * accompanies an error.)
 *
 * Every other warning is dropped. Since `@aufbau/compiler@0.0.9` a clean
 * compile carries its warnings, and the ones the engine has are not about the
 * student's proof: `AmbiguousAcuiMatch` says the hidden context binders of a
 * slack sequent rule could be split more than one way (they can; any split
 * proves the line), and the `Unused…`/`Unknown…` family is about the theory
 * and goal, which the instructor wrote. Underlining a correct line for either
