/**
 * Seed one of the demo lessons in `tests/helpers` onto a running LOCAL dev
 * server (`bun run dev`), as a published practice assignment. Logs in as
 * the local site_admin, creates a course, authors the lesson as a content
 * revision, publishes it, and prints the URLs to open.
 *
 *   bun run dev                                  # in another terminal
 *   bun run scripts/seed-demo.ts showcase
 *
 * The demos, by name:
 *
 *   showcase         every exercise type, each beside the source that made it
 *   forallx          forallx: Calgary TFL, as Fitch proofs
 *   prawitz          forallx natural deduction, drawn as Prawitz trees
 *   gentzen          Gentzen's classical sequent calculus (LK), as trees
 *   gentzen-starter  LK with pre-populated trees, published into an existing
 *                    course (default the "Truth Tables demo"; see --course)
 *   world            worlds of blocks: build, evaluate, counterexample,
 *                    distinguish
 *   truth-tree       forall x: UBC truth trees, typed and filled
 *
 * Flags: --base=URL (default http://localhost:8787), --email=ADDR,
 * --course=SUBSTRING (publish into the existing course whose title contains
 * it, rather than a new one).
 *
 * For a lesson in a file, `seed-lesson.ts --file=…`.
