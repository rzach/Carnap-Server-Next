/**
 * The showcase lesson is the one document that uses **every** exercise directive
 * the profile exposes, so compiling it is a cheap end-to-end check that no
 * directive has drifted out from under its own documentation: the lesson prints
 * each directive's source in a code fence next to the live exercise, so a syntax
 * change that breaks the exercise breaks this test too.
 *
 * Whether the worked proofs actually verify against the engine is checked by
 * `bun run scripts/showcase-verify.ts`, kept out of `bun test` for its cost:
 * every proof through the compiler's wasm, on every run.
