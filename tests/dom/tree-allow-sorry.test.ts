/**
 * `allow-sorry` in `<carnap-aufbau-proof-tree>`, standing in for all four
 * proof widgets (they share `readCompileResult` and the base's hold and gate;
 * this one is the island the fixture mounts). With the attribute, a rule
 * admitted with `sorry!` is a warning on the rule field rather than an error
 * on the line, the status line says the rest checks, and the proof is still
 * not correct: no certificate, mark idle. Outside an exam the widget will not
 * submit it and says why; on an exam it lets it go. And a submit that lands
 * while the compile is still pending waits for it, so the gate judges the
 * proof as it stands and not as it stood.
 *
 * The compiler is mocked at the module seam, as in `playground-tree.test.ts`:
 * a proof citing `sorry!` compiles `ok` with one `SorryLine` warning on the
 * token, as the real engine does (`tests/sorry-certificate.test.ts`).
