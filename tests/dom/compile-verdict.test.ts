/**
 * How a widget reads the compiler's result. The two things it must catch are
 * exactly the ones the engine does *not* fail on: a `sorry!` line, and a
 * warning on a clean compile.
 *
 * `sorry!` (engine 0.0.9) admits a line without a rule. The compile is `ok`
 * and returns an MMB, but that MMB carries a `Sorry` instruction, and the
 * worker's verifier — the trust boundary — refuses it. The reader withholds
 * the certificate and shows the line as a problem, so a student sees the
 * same verdict here as the server would give, rather than a green mark that
 * turns red on submit. An exercise with `allow-sorry` softens the problem to
 * a warning and says the proof is admitted; the certificate is withheld all
 * the same, since the verifier would refuse it all the same.
 *
 * The results here are shaped by hand: `@aufbau/compiler` is mocked for the
 * whole `bun test` run by `proof-compiler.test.ts`, so the real engine cannot
 * be loaded from a dom test. What the real engine returns for an admitted
 * line — `ok`, an MMB, one `SorryLine` warning — and that the verifier then
 * refuses the MMB, is pinned in `tests/sorry-certificate.test.ts`.
