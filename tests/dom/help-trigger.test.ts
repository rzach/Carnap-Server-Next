 * It used to be drawn by each widget's own toolbar, inside that widget's shadow
 * root: a different position in every widget that had one, and no position at all
 * in the ones with no toolbar. It is now one light-DOM button at the head of the
 * exercise's action bar, which is the row every one of the ten types ends with.
 *
 * The point of testing it here rather than through a widget is that the widgets
 * that use it are Preact islands over a WASM proof engine, and none of that is
 * involved in the question being asked. What can regress is this: which bar the
 * button lands in, whether it goes first, and whether it carries a name — the
 * glyph is decoration, so without one a screen reader announces "question mark".
