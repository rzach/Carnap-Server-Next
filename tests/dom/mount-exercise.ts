 * compile a document, render the exercise through the registry with the real
 * action bar and a hydration payload, wrap it in a submission form, adopt the
 * declarative shadow root, and connect it so it upgrades. One mount for every
 * type — the widget under test is whatever the document's directive names.
 *
 * Beside the tests rather than in `tests/helpers/`, because it is typed
 * against the DOM lib (`tsconfig.dom-tests.json`) and the helpers directory
 * is compiled against workers-types. It imports no component: a test that
 * mocks the compiler loader has to do so *before* the component module is
 * evaluated, and a static import here would run first. Each test file mocks
 * what it mocks (`./proof-compiler-mock`) and then imports the component
 * itself.
 *
 * jsdom does not implement declarative shadow DOM — `<template
 * shadowrootmode>` stays a template — so {@link mountExercise} performs the
 * adoption a browser's parser does, then inserts the element so it upgrades
 * with its shadow root already in place. That ordering is the point:
 * `enhance()` reads `this.shadowRoot`.
