/**
 * A hypothesis leaf in `<carnap-aufbau-proof-tree>` is a citation of one of
 * the goal's hypotheses, and looks like one: its text is the cited hypothesis
 * as the goal declares it, fixed rather than typed; its inference slot picks
 * which — a select where the goal offers a choice, a bare `#1` where it does
 * not; and the control that makes one is disabled where the goal declares
 * none. Before this, the leaf was seeded with a copy of the line below it and
 * a `#1` the student was to retype, over goals that mostly had no `#1`.
 *
 * The compiler is mocked at the module seam, as in `playground-tree.test.ts`;
 * that `#n` flattens and verifies is `tests/tree-proof-flatten.test.ts`'s.
