 * translator's structural complaint, a compiler diagnostic — is detail, and
 * `feedback="terse"` withholds detail. The parser's refusals used to reach
 * the line regardless: only the compiler's diagnostics were gated.
 *
 * Beside it, the one failure that used to say nothing at all: a compiler
 * that threw rather than reported left the forest blank and the spinner
 * stopped. The linear and Fitch editors put a sentence at the top of the
 * body for that; here it goes on the root line.
