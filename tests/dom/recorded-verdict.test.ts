 * the rendered HTML would show a regression here. It used to compare
 * `score >= maxScore`; the numbers can now be withheld while the verdict is
 * not, so it reads the verdict the server sends instead, and a mark that went
 * permanently idle would otherwise be invisible until someone looked at a page.
