/**
 * The import boundary between the exercise types and what they are built from.
 *
 * `src/worker/exercises/<type>/` is one exercise type per folder and
 * `src/worker/exercise-kit/` is what the types share, under one rule: a type
 * imports the kit, and the kit never imports a type. Nothing in the module
 * system enforces that, and the folder layout alone did not keep it — the four
 * proof types spent a year reaching into `aufbau-proof/` for their shared
 * helpers, and the Prawitz type read the tree type's parser, until the kit was
 * carved out. This test is what keeps the carving.
 *
 * Every rule prints the edges that break it, as `file → specifier`, so a
 * failure names the import to move rather than the rule it broke. Same ratchet
 * idiom as `tests/a11y` and the CSS fallback test: the list is empty and stays
 * empty.
 *
 * Only relative imports are read. A bare specifier is a package, and packages
 * are on the far side of a different boundary. And only `src/` is walked: the
 * verify scripts under `scripts/` reach into the proof types by name on
 * purpose — they are the types' own engine batteries, run by hand — and the
 * tests are the tests.
