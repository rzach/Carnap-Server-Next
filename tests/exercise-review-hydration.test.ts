/**
 * A read-only review is a *rendered widget*, not a picture of one: the Fitch
 * review really does upgrade and run client code, and the others may. So the
 * review markup has to carry the same hydration payload the answering path
 * carries — including `strings`, resolved for the viewer's locale.
 *
 * Nothing on the review path calls `t()` yet, which is exactly why this is
 * tested rather than observed: the first review-mode message would otherwise
 * render in English inside an otherwise translated page, silently.
 *
 * Which widgets are checked is the registry's answer, not a list here: every
 * type that declares `strings` is reviewed, over the showcase lesson (the one
 * document with an exercise of every kind), with a submitted answer from
 * `ANSWERS` below. A list once named four of them and left out the Prawitz
 * widget, whose review embeds a payload like the rest; a type this file has
 * no answer for now fails by name rather than going unlooked-at.
 *
 * Two reviews are drawn whole on the server and embed no payload at all —
 * the model's fields and the translation's formula are text, and their
 * elements do nothing in review mode. `SERVER_DRAWN` names them, so that a
 * new type is either checked here or declared inert, never merely missed.
