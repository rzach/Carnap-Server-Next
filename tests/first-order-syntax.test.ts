 * The language is `logic/theories/forallx-calgary-2019.mm0` — registered as a
 * spec under the same name, since that file is both — and the parser is
 * `@aufbau/syntax`; what is tested here is the pairing — that *this* spec, read
 * by *that* parser, is still the forallx of the 2019 Calgary edition, and that
 * a parse becomes the {@link Formula} tree the evaluators want. The library has
 * its own corpus for the parser itself.
 *
 * **Subscripted letters (`F_12`, `x_1`) are gone**, deliberately. The lexicon is
 * an MM0 signature, so the vocabulary is finite: 26 predicate letters and 18
 * function letters, no more. The hand parser this replaced lexed an unbounded
 * subscript, and Graham's call on 2026-08-24 was to accept the loss rather than
 * hold the unification for a library feature to restore it.
