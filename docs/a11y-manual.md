# Manual accessibility checklist

Use this checklist with the [automated tests](./a11y.md) to assess WCAG 2.2
AA behavior. Run it before each release and after substantial page or widget
changes. Record results in the sign-off table.

Test with:

- Keyboard only, without a mouse or trackpad.
- At least one screen reader: NVDA with Firefox on Windows, or VoiceOver
  with Safari on macOS.
- A current browser for zoom, spacing, and reflow checks.

Criterion numbers below identify the relevant WCAG success criteria. A
checked item records a test result, not a claim of complete conformance.

## Keyboard operation

Use Tab, Shift-Tab, arrows, Enter, Space, and Escape.

- [ ] **2.1.1 Keyboard:** every navigation link, form control, dialog, and
      exercise can be used without a pointer.
  - [ ] Multiple choice: select radios or checkboxes and reach Submit.
  - [ ] Truth table: the grid is one tab stop. Arrows move between cells;
        Home/End move to row ends; Ctrl+Home/End move to grid ends. Space or
        Enter cycles blank → T → F. Tab reaches Check and counterexample
        controls. Counterexample row radios form a separate tab stop before
        the cells; arrows select rows, and each radio names its row.
  - [ ] Linear and Fitch proofs: focus the CodeMirror editor, type, move the
        cursor, and leave it with the keyboard. Fitch scope lines require no
        interaction.
  - [ ] Proof tree: arrows navigate `treeitem` elements; Enter edits a
        conclusion; `r` edits a rule; Escape returns to navigation. Add a
        premise or hypothesis and delete a subtree using the keyboard.
  - [ ] Prawitz forest: arrows move focus without changing selection. Space
        selects the focused line; selections retain premise order. Premise
        buttons below roots are reachable. Enter/r/l/d edit line fields;
        a/b/p/h/Delete match the toolbar actions. An unselected focused line
        has a focus ring distinct from the selection highlight.
  - [ ] Proof problems, in all four proof widgets: with a problem in the
        proof, F8 and Shift-F8 go to the next and previous problem from
        anywhere in the widget, wrapping at the ends. In the linear and Fitch
        editors, Ctrl+Shift+M (Cmd+Shift+M on a Mac) opens the problem list;
        check the browser does not take the key first. Under terse or no
        feedback, F8 does nothing.
  - [ ] Model: reach and edit the domain, predicates, constants, and function
        values, then Check and Submit.
  - [ ] Translation: edit the formula, check with Enter, and reach Submit.
  - [ ] Free response and short answer: edit the text and reach Submit.
  - [ ] Markdown source: editable and read-only views are each one tab stop,
        and arrows move the cursor in both. Ctrl+Shift+[ and Ctrl+Shift+]
        fold and unfold the current block with an announcement. The folded
        `…` placeholder is independently focusable and can unfold the block.
        The hidden gutter is not required for keyboard operation.
  - [ ] Split view: Write, Split, and Preview expose the correct pressed
        state. Below 70rem, Split is unavailable and the selected button
        matches the visible column. In Split, the boundary is a focusable
        separator: Left/Right resize it, Home/End reach its limits, and
        `aria-valuenow` updates.
- [ ] **2.1.2 No keyboard trap:** Tab can leave editors and contenteditable
      fields. Modal focus stays inside only while the modal is open.
- [ ] **2.4.3 Focus order:** Tab follows reading order, including in dialogs.
- [ ] **2.4.7 Focus visible:** every focused control has a visible indicator.
      In tree-editor fields, also check that the caret remains visible after
      typing. Their editable boxes must not lose the caret in inline layout.
- [ ] **2.4.11 Focus not obscured:** headers and dialog edges do not hide the
      focused control.
- [ ] **2.5.7 Dragging:** dragging has a non-drag alternative. The split-view
      separator supports keyboard resizing as well as dragging; double-click
      restores its initial position. Check the same requirement for any new
      drag interaction.

## Dialogs

- [ ] **2.4.3 / 2.1.2:** opening moves focus inside. Escape and a backdrop
      click close the dialog, and focus returns to the trigger. Drag-selecting
      from a field past the panel edge does not close it.
- [ ] Widget Help opens from `(?)`, or `?` on a focused tree or Prawitz
      line. The linear and Fitch editors open it from `(?)` only, since `?`
      types there. It appears near its trigger without scrolling the page.
      The heading names the dialog, and key tables read as key/action pairs.
- [ ] Test Help in a long embedded lesson, not just fullscreen. The iframe
      spans the whole lesson, so positioning at the frame's center could put
      the dialog outside the visible page area.

## Screen-reader semantics and announcements

- [ ] **1.1.1 Non-text content:** meaningful images and icons have names;
      decoration is hidden. The ⊨ brand and review ✓/✗ marks do not announce
      as unexplained punctuation.
- [ ] **1.3.1 Information and relationships:** headings, lists, tables, and
      field labels are announced correctly. Tree nodes expose their role and
      selection. Sortable table headings become buttons after enhancement;
      exactly one sorted column exposes ascending or descending `aria-sort`.
- [ ] **2.4.6 Headings and labels:** each page has a descriptive main heading
      and a logical outline. Check the project's single-`h1` convention.
- [ ] **3.3.2 Labels and instructions:** input purpose and required state are
      available without relying on visual placement or color.
- [ ] **1.3.1 / 4.1.2 Exercise groups:** entering an exercise announces its
      title, or its kind if untitled. Truth-table cells announce column, row,
      and value in words. Each proof workspace has a name. Enhanced widgets
      do not retain `aria-busy`.
- [ ] **4.1.2 Name, role, value:** custom widgets expose current state,
      including truth-table `aria-pressed`, tree `aria-selected`, Prawitz
      premise-button names and pressed state, and publication toggles.
- [ ] **4.1.3 Status messages:** submission and local-check results are
      announced without moving focus or repeatedly announcing typing updates.

## Forms and errors

- [ ] **3.3.1 Error identification:** errors are announced and identify the
      relevant field in text.
  - [ ] Proof problems: F8 says each problem. In the tree and Prawitz
        editors it is read as the line's description when focus arrives, and
        the field at fault reads as invalid. In the linear and Fitch editors
        it is announced after the selected text. With no problems, F8 says
        "No problems."
- [ ] **3.3.3 Error suggestion:** messages explain how to fix a problem when
      a correction is known.
- [ ] **1.4.1 Use of color:** required, incorrect, and correct states have a
      text, icon, or accessible-label equivalent.

## Reflow, zoom, and spacing

- [ ] **1.4.10 Reflow:** at 320 CSS px, ordinary content does not require
      horizontal scrolling. Check wide tables and exercise layouts separately
      where a two-dimensional layout is necessary.
- [ ] **1.4.4 Resize text:** at 200% zoom, text remains readable and controls
      are not clipped or overlapping.
- [ ] **1.4.12 Text spacing:** apply line height 1.5 times the font size,
      paragraph spacing 2 times, letter spacing 0.12 times, and word spacing
      0.16 times. No content or functionality is lost.
- [ ] Content iframes reflow and send updated heights to their parent without
      creating a nested scrollbar trap.

## Motion and timing

- [ ] **2.2.1 Timing adjustable:** review time limits, warnings, extensions,
      and any applicable exceptions. A timeout must not unexpectedly trap
      users or discard essential work without an appropriate remedy.
- [ ] **2.3.1 Three flashes:** nothing flashes more than three times per
      second unless it meets the criterion's threshold exception.
- [ ] **2.2.2 Pause, stop, hide:** review persistent animation, including
      checking spinners, for the applicable pause or stop requirements.

## Documents and contrast

- [ ] **3.1.1 Language:** each page and content iframe has the correct
      `<html lang>`.
- [ ] **1.4.3 / 1.4.11 Contrast:** check text, controls, and state indicators
      in both palettes, including glyph-only controls and authored CSS that
      the automated fixtures do not cover.
- [ ] **2.4.2 Page titled:** each page and content document has a meaningful
      `<title>`.
